        "text": "MindBloom\nBack to Home\nAbout MindBloom\nOur Story\n\nMindBloom was founded in 2024 by our founder Liam Adams, who wanted to create a better way for students with ADHD and OCD to stay organized. Having personally struggled with focus and productivity, Liam realized that most task management tools weren't built with neurodivergent users in mind.\n\nTraditional planners and to-do lists often felt overwhelming or uninspiring, making it difficult to stick with them. That's when the idea for MindBloom was born: a system that doesn't just track tasks but actively motivates users through gamification, cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, and a visually engaging interface.\n\nToday, MindBloom helps kids, teens, and adults break down tasks, set goals, and build productive habits in a way that feels intuitive and rewarding. By turning organization into an engaging experience, we empower users to take control of their schedules, reduce stress, and unlock their full potential.\n\nHow MindBloom Works\nTask Management with a Twist\nCreate Tasks Your Way\n\nAdd tasks with customizable priorities, categories, and due dates. Break down complex projects into manageable steps with our intuitive interface.\n\nSmart Scheduling\n\nPlan your day with our calendar view that integrates with Google Calendar. Schedule tasks based on priority and available time slots.\n\nTimely Reminders\n\nNever miss a deadline with customizable reminders that work with your brain, not against it. Choose from various notification styles.\n\nPomodoro Technique\n\nBoost focus with our built-in Pomodoro timer. Work in focused sprints with scheduled breaks to maintain productivity without burnout.\n\nAchievement System\n\nEarn points, badges, and rewards as you complete tasks. Our achievement system keeps you motivated and celebrates your progress.\n\nVirtual Garden\n\nWatch your virtual garden grow as you complete tasks. Each completed task helps your plants flourish, creating a visual representation of your productivity.\n\nThe MindBloom Workflow\n1\nPlan Your Tasks\n\nAdd tasks to your dashboard, categorize them, and set priorities. MindBloom helps you break down complex projects into manageable steps.\n\n2\nSchedule Your Day\n\nUse the calendar view to plan when you'll tackle each task. Our smart scheduling suggests optimal times based on your productivity patterns.\n\n3\nFocus and Execute\n\nUse the Pomodoro timer to work in focused sprints. MindBloom helps you maintain concentration and avoid distractions.\n\n4\nTrack and Celebrate\n\nMark tasks as complete to earn rewards and watch your garden grow. Review your productivity insights to identify patterns and improve your workflow.\n\nTry MindBloom Today\nOur Mission\n\nTo transform productivity from a burden into a journey of growth and achievement, making task management engaging and rewarding for everyone.\n\nWe believe that everyone deserves tools that work with their brain, not against it.
